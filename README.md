## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

I completed this challenge as a way to get re-acquainted with HTML/CSS since I was without a computer for a while. I re-learned how to structure HTML markup and used CSS flexbox to complete this challenge. I built each side of the component separately, breaking each piece down to create a cohesive final product. I refreshed my memory about centering divs and centering the content inside of the div.

### Continued development

I want to work more with flexbox and make sure that my use of padding/margin is correct and works with different screen sizes.

### Useful resources

- [CSSmatic Box Shadow Generator](https://www.cssmatic.com/box-shadow) - I used this tool to create the box shadow effect on the card component. I found it very useful.
- [MDN Adding vector graphics to the web](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/HTML/Multimedia_and_embedding/Adding_vector_graphics_to_the_Web) - I consulted this MDN page to make sure I was adding my SVG icons correctly.
